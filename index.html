            So you want to learn how to make games? Well that's a complete mistake on your part already, but I digress. The best way to get started is to start with something basic, such as recreating a known game. We'll start with <strong>Snake</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            For a simple game such as snake, and assuming you already know how to program, there are only a few things that need to really be considered.
            <ul id="breakdown">
                <li>Establishing the rules of the game</li>
                <li>Writing the logic / establishing the structure</li>
                <li>Taking inputs / setting up controls</li>
                <li>Drawing the graphics</li>
            </ul>
            Unfortunately for most people, this guide is focused on using C as the main language, and being written specifically for windows.
            <br>
            For any windows users, you can download my rudimentary version of snake <a class="download" href="snake3.exe">here</a>. Which includes screen wrapping, which shouldn't actually exist in the original game.
