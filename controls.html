        <h2>Controls and Input Handling</h2>
        <div id="content">
        Before we get started on setting up the control scheme, we should remember these two rules:
            <ul id="rules">
                <li>The snake is constantly moving, one tile at a time</li>
                <li>The snake cannot travel backwards directly into itself, thus ending the game (it can however, make two 90 degree turns to move backwards).</li>
            </ul>
        Since Snake is a simple two dimensional game, there are only 4 directions the player could be moving in at any given moment. It helps with readability to establish the following global constants.
        <br>
<span class="codeblock"><blockquote><pre><code>int UP = 0;
int DOWN = 1;
int LEFT = 2;
int RIGHT = 3;</code></pre></blockquote></span>
So that we do not need to remember the actual values when writing comparisons, and can instead write:
<span class="codeblock"><blockquote><pre><code>if (Direction == UP and InputDirection != DOWN){
    Direction = InputDirection;
}
</code></pre></blockquote></span>
When checking the input.
(But also, there's a better way to do this, involving modulus math, and only a single conditional statement, instead of 4, but that wouldn't make this a simple guide if I had to explain it.)
<br>
<br>
Anyways, onto the basics of getting keyboard input. One of the easiest ways to do so, would be to first import conio.h and use two functions kbhit() and getch().
<span class="codeblock"><blockquote><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;conio.h&gt;
void main(){
    while (1){
        int input;
        if (kbhit()){
            input = getch();
            printf("%d\n",input);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></blockquote></span>
The above code is just an infinite loop that tells you what key you've just pressed.

<br>
The results for pressing up, down, left, and right respectively. Notice how there is always a preceeding 224. This is special to arrow keys, and needs to be deal with.
<br>
<br>
As the arrow keys will return 72, 80, 75, and 77 for the keys up, down, left, right instead of 0, 1, 2, 3. We need to reassign the values with a simple switch case statement to make it consistent with the constants we established earlier.
<span class="codeblock"><blockquote><pre><code>int GetInput(){
    int input;
    if (kbhit()){
        input = getch();
        input = getch(); //We need to do this twice, as it returns 224 the first time for arrow key inputs
        //left =75, up = 72,down = 80, right = 77
        switch(input){
            case 75:
                input = LEFT;
            break;
            case 77:
                input = RIGHT;
            break;
            case 72:
                input = UP;
            break;
            case 80:
                input = DOWN;
            break;
            }
        }
    }
    return input;
}
</code></pre></blockquote></span>
