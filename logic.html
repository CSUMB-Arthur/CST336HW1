            <br/>
            In making snake, we can use a 2 dimensional array of integers to represent segments of the snake, and food pellets. A way to go about doing this is by using -1 as a value for a pellet, 0 as an empty space, and anything 1 and above as a snake.

            The head of the snake, as it moves, will set the value of a tile to the integer SnakeLength. This means it'll take that many "turns" for it to expire, which gives the illusion of the snake moving. 
            <br>When growing the snake, we can just increment SnakeLength and all body tiles (anything >= 1), by a fixed value GrowLength.
            The snake head can be represented using the following variables.
            <blockquote class="codeblock"><pre><code>int X;
int Y;
int Direction;
int SnakeLength</code></pre></blockquote>
            Our mainloop will consist of the following components:
            <ul>
                <li>Get player directional input (if it exists)</li>
                <li>Check if input is valid</li>
                <li>Update Direction value if necessary</li>
                <li>Move snake according to direction value</li>
                <li>Check if the new location contains the boundary wall, or a body segment</li>
                <li>If so, end the game</li>
                <li>Check if the location contains food</li>
                <li>If so, update body segment tiles and SnakeLength variable</li>
                <li>Draw the screen on the console</li>
            </ul>
